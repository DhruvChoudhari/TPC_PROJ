# Training-Placement-Cell-Portal


ABOUT:

A Web Application for Training and Placement Cell (TPC) which acts as an intermdediate for connecting student to companies. Created on HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL(as database). The site has mainly 4 attributes : 1)Admin , 2)Student , 3)Company, 4)Alumni .
Each attribite has their own pages and features. Details for each users are stored in SQL table (screenshot is given below), ER Daigram is also added.

In order to obtain an account, a student or company must register. The admin then reviews the information and, if it appears legitimate, either approves or denies the request. The user can login, see, and change his information after having his account approved by the admin. Companies can advertise job openings that are visible to all students. When a person applies for an opportunity, the company's eligibility requirements are examined; if the person meets them, further processing will be permitted. 
The admin has the authority to view any post or event and edit/delete it.  
Graduated students are transferred to the Alumni Section (partial implementation in progress).
